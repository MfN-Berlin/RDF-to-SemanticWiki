Import an ontology into a semantic MediaWiki

Maintaining a semantic MediaWiki can be a lot of work. 
A solution is to apply model-based development. 
The ontology becomes the model, and the semantic MediaWiki is its implementation.

## Usage example
An example ontology is included in the folder "example". This ontology, Calendar.owl, models an event calendar, such as from thunderbird etc. 

1. A graphical representation is provided in Calendar.svg. You can view the svg file using any svg viewer. 
The graphical representation was made using VOWL (http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html)
2. To edit the example, use an ontology editor, such as Protege (webprotege.stanford.edu) to edit the Calendar.owl file
3. When you're done, import the ontology into MediaWiki (in progress)
