# Pitch
## Idea
Semantic wikis have been supporting research at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Berlin (Museum of Natural History Berlin) in multiple ways since 2015, and the experience gained demonstrates that creating and maintaining a semantic wiki is challenging, and requires a methodical approach.

## Pitch title
Creating ontology-based semantic wikis at the Museum of Natural History Berlin

## Key Points
* Semantic wikis support research at the natural history museum by providing services for developing and documenting collection management and imaging procedures or annotating archive material. On the other hand, some wikis are available on the Web, as publication medium for conference presentations or providing additional material for exhibitions. A total of 15 semantic wikis are currently online on the museum's servers.
* Semantic wikis combine the metadata and conformance aspects required by knowledge management, with the possibility to access and build-upon a corpus of collaboratively collected knowledge. On the down side, maintaining a semantic wiki is challenging.
* Coping with increasing complexity of the wikis led to the development of a methodical approach for simplifying the creation and maintenance of semantic wikis: modelling the semantic relationships underlying the information in the wiki as an ontology, and then automatically creating the wiki from the ontology constructs.
* Benefits gained: a methodical approach for creating and maintaining wikis greatly simplifies these tasks, so ensures that wikis will continue to be supported at the Museum of Natural History Berlin. Reusing vocabularies and taxonomies throught several projects becomes much more manageable.
