Import an ontology into a semantic MediaWiki

Maintaining a semantic MediaWiki can be a lot of work. 
A solution is to apply model-based development. 
The ontology becomes the model, and the semantic MediaWiki is its implementation.

Usage:
# Build an ontology, e.g. using Protege (webprotege.stanford.edu)
# Visualize your ontology e.g. using VOWL (http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html)
# When you're done, import the ontology into MediaWiki (TODO)
